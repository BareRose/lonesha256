## Documentation

This is a header-only library, as such most of its functional documentation is contained within the "header section" of the
source code in the form of comments. It is highly recommended that you read said documentation before using this library.

## Features

The lonesha256 library provides portable sha256 hashing in a single function, its features include:

- No hard dependencies besides the standard library, making it fully portable
- Avoids endianness issues by relying entirely on endian-agnostic operations
- Simple hashing in a single function without any convoluted initialization
